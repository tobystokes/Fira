## Homelyfe version
This version has some new ligatures on Fira Sans Bold to recreate the [Homelyfe](http:www.homelyfe.com) logo. 

## Hidden features
- 'yf' ligature - to improve kernability as per the logo.
- 'HH' ligature - to recreate the House logo. Bold weight only.

## How to install
- [→ Download just the useful weights, as a zip file.](https://github.com/tobystokes/Fira/releases/download/h1.0/FiraSans-requiredweights.zip)
- Unzip.
- On Mac OS, double click the '.otf' font files, they should open with the Font Book app.
- Click on the install button.
- You may need to restart currently running apps before the fonts show up in their menu.

### Microsoft Office use:
- Make sure ligatures are enabled. [→ enable ligatures in Office](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microsoft+office+ligatures)

### Google Docs use:
- Enable the standard web version of the font. (Down to 'More fonts...' at the bottom of the font menu, and then search for Fira.)
- If you have the customised version installed, then that will override the standard one, but be aware that if sharing the document, then the logo won't show!
